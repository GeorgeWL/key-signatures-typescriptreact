# Chords Learning App

For helping me learn music theory for my hobby of singing, I'm building this application of Flash Cards for Key Signatures and the Triads of those key signatures

**Until full release, all updates onto main branch unless a refactor. On release, use feature trunking (branch then merge after completion)**

## TODO:

- [ ] Create Clef with Bass or Treble as property
- [x] Create Key Signature with Sharp(`#`) or Flat (`♭`)
- [ ] Create Flashcard which shows Clef with Key Signature and aks you to Select what the chord name is
- [ ] Create Flashcard which shows a Clef with Scale on it ands ask for one to place #/♭ on the barline
- [ ] Create barlines with position as property
- [ ] create Triads fill in the blank for each tonic triad
